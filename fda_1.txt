NVIC0012	Sucrose	0.84	DB02772	Not Available	1.0936																				
NVIC0015	Remdesivir	1	DB14761	Data regarding overdoses of remdesivir are not readily available. Overdoses of other nucleoside analogs like acyclovir can be managed with symptomatic and supportive treatment.	Not Available																				
NVIC0035	Phenythoin	1	DB00252	Phenytoin toxicity most often affects the cardiovascular and nervous systems. The most common presentation of toxicity depends on the route of administration. Cardiovascular adverse effects are most commonly linked to intravenous phenytoin administration, whereas neurological adverse effects are more common with oral phenytoin administration.	2.1567																				
NVIC0051	Caffeine	1	DB00201	In the case of caffeine overdose, seizures may occur, as caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. Symptoms of overdose may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal upset. Intoxication with caffeine is included in the World Health Organizationâ€™s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Agitation, anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, tachycardia, tremors, tachycardia, psychomotor agitation, and, in some cases, death can occur, depending on the amount of caffeine consumed. Overdose is more likely to occur in individuals who do not consume caffeine regularly but consume energy drinks.	2.9741																				
NVIC0052	Verapamil hydrochloride	0.98	DB00661	As there is no antidote for verapamil overdosage, treatment is largely supportive. Symptoms of overdose are generally consistent with verapamil's adverse effect profile (i.e. hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmia) but instances of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema have been observed following ingestion of large overdoses (up to 9 grams).	3.4137																				
NVIC0054	Chloroquine phosphate	0.88	DB00608	Patients experiencing an overdose may present with headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, cardiovascular collapse, shock, convulsions, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and hypokalemia. Overdose should be managed with symptomatic and supportive treatment which may include prompt emesis, gastric lavage, and activated charcoal.	2.9547																				
NVIC0055	Quinacrine	0.96	DB01103	Symptoms of overdose include seizures, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse.	2.8888																				
NVIC0058	Doxorubicin hydrochloride	0.99	DB00997	Doxorubicin hydrochloride treatment can increase the risk of secondary malignancies based on postmarketing reports. Doxorubicin hydrochloride was mutagenic in the in vitro Ames assay, and clastogenic in multiple in vitro assays (CHO cell, V79 hamster cell, human lymphoblast, and SCE assays) and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Based on postmarketing reports, pediatric patients treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride are at risk for developing late cardiovascular dysfunction. Risk factors include young age at treatment (especially < 5 years), high cumulative doses and receipt of combined modality therapy. Long-term periodic cardiovascular monitoring is recommended for all pediatric patients who have received doxorubicin hydrochloride. Doxorubicin hydrochloride, as a component of intensive chemotherapy regimens administered to pediatric patients, may contribute to prepubertal growth failure and may also contribute to gonadal impairment, which is usually temporary.	2.6644																				
NVIC0061	Gabapentin	1	DB00996	Symptoms of overdose are consistent with the drug's adverse effect profile and involve CNS depression (e.g. dizziness, drowsiness, slurred speech, lethargy, loss of consciousness) and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea. Multi-drug overdoses involving gabapentin, particularly in combination with other CNS depressants such as opioids, can result in coma and death - this possibility should be considered when managing overdosage.	1.6472																				
NVIC0062	Crystal violet	0.96	DB00406	Oral administration can cause gastrointestinal irritation, and intravenous injection can cause depression in the white blood cell count.	2.5102																				
NVIC0065	Ribavirin	1	DB00811	Rivabirin and PEG-Interferon Alfa-2A dual therapy is associated with flu-like symptoms, depression, suicide, insomnia, irritability, relapse of drug abuse/overdose, hepatic decompensation in 2% of HIV co-infected patients and bacterial infections each occurring at a frequency of less than 1%. Ribavirin-induced anemia is a dose-dependent adverse effect where reduced hemoglobin levels can be seen within the first 1-2 weeks in therapy.	1.9876																				
NVIC0066	Bortezomib	1	DB00188	The symptoms from overdose included the acute onset of symptomatic hypotension and thrombocytopenia. As there is no known antidote for bortezomib overdosage, monitoring of vital signs and appropriate supportive care should be initiated when drug overdosage is suspected. In monkeys and dogs, increased heart rate, decreased contractility, hypotension, and death were observed with the intravenous dose as low as two times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2 basis. A case of a slight increase in the corrected QT interval leading to death occurred in dog studies.	2.4537

NVIC0083	Nisoldipine	0.8	DB00401	Not Available	2.6277																				
NVIC0083	Nifedipine	1	DB01115	Patients experiencing an overdose may present with hypotension, sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular node dysfunction, and reflex tachycardia.	2.5425																				
NVIC0084	Tamoxifen	0.9	DB00675	High doses of tamoxifen in animals lead to respiratory difficulty and convulsions. High doses in advanced metastatic cancer patients resulted in acute neurotoxicity seen by tremor, hyperreflexia, unsteady gait, and dizziness.	1.9882																				
NVIC0090	Phenoxybenzamine HCl	0.97	DB00925	Symptoms of overdose are largely the result of block of the sympathetic nervous system and of the circulating epinephrine. They may include postural hypotension resulting in dizziness or fainting, tachycardia, particularly postural, vomiting; lethargy, and shock.	2.1163																				
NVIC0091	Praziquantel	1	DB01058	Praziquantel had no effect on fertility and general reproductive performance of male and female rats when given at oral doses ranging from 30 to 300 mg/kg body weight (up to 0.65 times the human daily dose based on body surface area)	2.0726																				
NVIC0093	Propranolol hydrochloride	0.97	DB00571	Symptoms of overdose include hypotension, hypoglycemic seizure, restlessness, euphoria, insomnia. Patients with asthma may develop bronchospasm	2.5625																				
NVIC0096	Cyclosporine	1	DB00091	There are little data available in the literature regarding overdoses with cyclosporine, but hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity may occur. One case report of an cyclosporine overdose due to medical error was made involving a 26 year old female and noted the occurrence of nausea, flushing, tremor, vertigo and vomiting, which resolved within about 1 day. Anorexia and a feeling of increased body girth were also experienced by this patient and resolved within about 2 weeks.	2.8788																				
NVIC0102	Bosutinib	1	DB06616	Fetal exposure to bosutinib-derived radioactivity during pregnancy was demonstrated in a placental-transfer study in pregnant rats. Experience with bosutinib overdose in clinical studies was limited to isolated cases. There were no reports of any serious adverse events associated with the overdoses.	2.4201																				
NVIC0111	Amlodipine besylate	1	DB00381	An overdose of amlodipine could result in a high degree of peripheral vasodilatation with a possibility of reflex tachycardia. Significant and prolonged hypotension leading to shock and fatal outcomes have been reported	2.5396																				
NVIC0117	Chloroquine phosphate	1	DB00608	Patients experiencing an overdose may present with headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, cardiovascular collapse, shock, convulsions, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and hypokalemia.	2.9547
